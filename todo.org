* TODO Option to put subtext next to main text

  Compatible with aligned subtext, like this:
  
  DeleteAllFiles /function/      Deletes all your files.
  Quit /function/                Get up and leave. 
  
* TODO Refine substring/flex matching
  - If the first character of a flex match is also the first character of the item, show that item before items with
    substring (not prefix) matching. The longer the match at the start, the higher the score.
  - The same at the end of string. Useful when choosing filenames with paths.
