* alien-sel: A list choice library for emacs.

Call *alien-sel* with a prompt and a list of choices, and a vertical list is shown for choosing with arrow keys. The
minibuffer is activated for filtering.

** Features:

- Filter options by typing in the minibuffer. Substring/regexp/'flex' matching available.
- Push filters to narrow selection.
- Text of the items can be propertized. The property =alien-sel-val= allows to specify a value to return different from the value to show.

** Goals:

- ido is great, but the minibuffer is too far away from the editing most of the time.
- Small library, but with categorization, filtering, and extra information for items. Most of this is not yet implemented.

** Keys:
| =return=  | Select the highlighted item and exit.                                                                                                 |
| =M-up=    | Activate the window with the list, to resize it, copy text, etc. Once there, use =M-down= or =C-g= to get back to the minibuffer.              |
| =C-+=     | Cycle filter types. Types available are: prefix/substring/flex, prefix/substring (flex may be slow on huge lists), and regexp.          |
| =M-+=     | Toggle numbering of list elements.                                                                                                    |
| =up=      | Move selection up.                                                                                                                    |
| =down=    | Move selection down.                                                                                                                  |
| =next=    | Move selection down a few lines.                                                                                                      |
| =prior=   | Move selection up a few lines.                                                                                                        |
| =home=    | Move selection to the first element.                                                                                                  |
| =end=     | Move selection to the last element.                                                                                                   |
| =S-down=  | Increase the number of visible elements.                                                                                              |
| =S-up=    | Decrease the number of visible elements.                                                                                              |
| =C-return= | Pushes the current filter to the filter stack. The filtered list becomes the default list. The filter stack is shown in the modeline. |
| =M-return= | Pops one element from the filter stack. |
| =C-cÂ 1= | Deletes all other windows, so the list window takes the whole frame. |
| =M-down= | Fall back to completing-read. |



** Next:
- Some documentation.
- Popup version.
- When selecting the listing window, allow to make a choice from there too.
- Item categories, by prefix or explicit. Allow to filter out categories.
- When flex matching, if the first character of the filter is also the first character of the item, show that item before items with substring (not prefix) matching.
- tab completion, initial input.
