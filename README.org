** Features:

- Filter options by typing in the minibuffer. Substring/regexp/'flex' matching available.
- Push filters to narrow selection.


** Keys:
| =return=  | Select the highlighted item and exit.                                                                                                 |
| =M-up=    | Activate the window with the list, to resize it, copy text, etc. Once there, use =M-down= or =C-g= to get back to the minibuffer.              |
| =C-+=     | Cycle filter types. Types available are: prefix/substring/flex, prefix/substring (flex may be slow on huge lists), and regexp.          |
| =M-+=     | Toggle numbering of list elements.                                                                                                    |

| =S-down=  | Increase the number of visible elements.                                                                                              |

- Some documentation.
- Popup version.
- Commands to degrade to ido, completing-read.
- A command to take the entire frame.
- When selecting the listing window, allow to make a choice from there too.
- Item categories, by prefix or explicit. Allow to filter out categories.
- When flex matching, if the first character of the filter is also the first character of the item, show that item before items with substring (not prefix) matching.
